# Sample Onboarding Flow using UIPageViewController
Prototype for onboarding type flow using a UIPageViewController which is a subview of a parent View Controller container.  The container is used to control a top view with a progress bar. 

The onboarding flow is used by simply initializing the SamplePageContainerViewController with an array of View Controllers that conform to a CTA protocol.
